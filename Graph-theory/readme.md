## Graph theory
In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines).

What is a graph theory?

A graph theory is a study of graphs in discrete mathematics. The graphs here are represented by vertices (V) and edges (E). A graph here is symbolised as G(V, E).
