## rumor

_**Rumors mislead judgments of people, affect economic development, and the stability of social order. The research on the rule of spreading rumors is significant and meaningful**_.

01):

A rumor (American English), or rumour (British English; see spelling differences; derived from Latin rumorem 'noise'), is "a tall tale of explanations of events circulating from person to person and pertaining to an object, event, or issue in public concern."

02):

In the social sciences, a rumor involves a form of a statement whose veracity is not quickly or ever confirmed. In addition, some scholars have identified rumor as a subset of propaganda. Sociology, psychology, and communication studies have widely varying definitions of rumor.

Rumors are also often discussed with regard to misinformation and disinformation (the former often seen as simply false and the latter seen as deliberately false, though usually from a government source given to the media or a foreign government).

What is the difference between rumor and gossip?

Rumors are unsubstantiated information and stories. Rumors can be true or false; their main characteristic is doubt. For example, “I have heard that our company is going to layoff 500 employees”. Gossip is evaluative social chat. For example, persons A and B are having an affair. Rumors and gossip differ in their primary function. Rumors are used to warn or inform the group about uncertain events or phenomena (rumored layoffs warn fellow employees—“better prepare for the job losses”). Gossip enforces social mores (it’s bad to have an extra-marital affair), is often slanderous, and/or amuses and fascinates the discussants.

A statement can be both rumor and gossip, as when the information is both doubtful and slanderous (e.g. the false rumor that “Hillary is running a secret child pornography business.”) Rumor and gossip are sometimes impossible to distinguish from one another, but they do possess some distinct connotations. For example, the objection “That’s a rumor!” often signifies that a statement is false or doubtful, while “That’s gossip!” can indicate slanderous and titillating information shared in idle conversation.

What is the best way to deal with rumors or misinformation about yourself in the media/social media? Should you speak up to correct the info or stay silent?

Assuming that a harmful rumor is indeed false, it is generally better to speak up, especially if you feel the rumor has potential to cause you or others harm. When heard by people who are inclined to dis-believe the rumor, a refutation offers them the opportunity to do so. Conversely, if those inclined to believe the rumor do not hear a refutation, they will interpret the refutation’s absence as proof of the rumor’s truth (e.g., “They didn’t refute it, it must be that they couldn’t refute it.”). [We say this cautiously, recognizing that a refutation may be discounted as self-serving, and that a refutation runs the risk of repeating and drawing attention to the rumor.]

A refutation is most effective when given by a third party considered credible by the targeted audience. Thus, although it may be challenging to accomplish, the recommendation is to enlist the help of persons seen as credible in the eyes of the audience.
