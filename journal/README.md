1. What is meant by a random graph?
— https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RandomGraph.html

A random graph is a graph in which properties such as the number of graph vertices, graph edges, and connections between them are determined in some random way. The graphs illustrated above are random graphs on 10 vertices with edge probabilities distributed uniformly in [0,1].

Erdős and Rényi (1960) showed that for many monotone-increasing properties of random graphs, graphs of a size slightly less than a certain threshold are very unlikely to have the property, whereas graphs with a few more graph edges are almost certain to have it. This is known as a phase transition (Janson et al. 2000, p. 103). Almost all graphs are connected and nonplanar (Skiena 1990, p. 156).

2. What is a random graph called?
— https://dshizuka.github.io/networkanalysis/09_randomnets.html

The simplest type of random graph is what is called the Erdös-Renyí Random Graph. This is what people typically mean when they say “Random Graph” (though, you will see later, that there are many different ways to be random). These come in two flavors: G(n,m) model, in which n nodes are randomly connected by m edges.

Abstract
This chapter reviews graph generation techniques in the context of applications. The first case study is power grids, where proposed strategies to prevent blackouts have been tested on tailored random graphs. The second case study is in social networks. Applications of random graphs to social networks are extremely wide ranging – the particular aspect looked at here is modelling the spread of disease on a social network – and how a particular construction based on projecting from a bipartite graph successfully captures some of the clustering observed in real social networks. The third case study is on null models of food webs, discussing the specific constraints relevant to this application, and the topological features which may contribute to the stability of an ecosystem. The final case study is taken from molecular biology, discussing the importance of unbiased graph sampling when considering if motifs are over-represented in a protein–protein interaction network.
