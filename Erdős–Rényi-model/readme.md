## Erdős–Rényi model

What is the application of erdos renyi model?

Erdos Renyi model is used to create random networks or graphs on social networking. In the Erdos Reny model, each edge has a fixed probability of being present and being absent independent of the edges in a network.

What is the Erdos and Renyi random network?

In graph theory, the Erdos–Rényi model is either of two closely related models for generating random graphs. There are two closely related variants of the Erdos–Rényi (ER) random graph model. In the G(n, M) model, a graph is chosen uniformly at random from the collection of all graphs which have n nodes and M edges.

What is the clustering coefficient of the Erdos-Renyi graph?

Erdos-Renyi has almost No Clustering

For very large graphs with fixed degree (ˉk is a fixed constant), the clustering coefficient goes to zero. In other words, if we generate bigger and bigger graphs with fixed average degree ˉk (by setting p=ˉkn−1), then ˜C(G) decreases with the graph size n.

What is the main difference between the erdos renyi and gilbert models or random graphs?

In the model of Erdős and Rényi, all graphs on a fixed vertex set with a fixed number of edges are equally likely. In the model introduced by Gilbert, also called the Erdős–Rényi–Gilbert model, each edge has a fixed probability of being present or absent, independently of the other edges.

What is the density of a graph?

Graph density represents the ratio between the edges present in a graph and the maximum number of edges that the graph can contain. Conceptually, it provides an idea of how dense a graph is in terms of edge connectivity. It's particularly useful when we have a vast network and want to add new edges to the network.

What are the 5 basic terms used in graph theory?

The concept of graphs in graph theory stands up on some basic terms such as point, line, vertex, edge, degree of vertices, properties of graphs, etc.
