## Erdős–Rényi model

What is the application of erdos renyi model?

Erdos Renyi model is used to create random networks or graphs on social networking. In the Erdos Reny model, each edge has a fixed probability of being present and being absent independent of the edges in a network.

What is the Erdos and Renyi random network?

In graph theory, the Erdos–Rényi model is either of two closely related models for generating random graphs. There are two closely related variants of the Erdos–Rényi (ER) random graph model. In the G(n, M) model, a graph is chosen uniformly at random from the collection of all graphs which have n nodes and M edges.

What is the clustering coefficient of the Erdos-Renyi graph?

Erdos-Renyi has almost No Clustering

For very large graphs with fixed degree (ˉk is a fixed constant), the clustering coefficient goes to zero. In other words, if we generate bigger and bigger graphs with fixed average degree ˉk (by setting p=ˉkn−1), then ˜C(G) decreases with the graph size n.
