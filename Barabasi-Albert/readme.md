## Barabasi Albert

What are the properties of Barabasi Albert model?

The Barabási–Albert model is one of several proposed models that generate scale-free networks. It incorporates two important general concepts: growth and preferential attachment. Both growth and preferential attachment exist widely in real networks.

What is Barabasi law?

In summary, the Barabási-Albert model indicates that two simple mechanisms, growth and preferential attachment, are responsible for the emergence of scale-free networks. The origin of the power law and the as- sociated hubs is a rich-gets-richer phenomenon induced by the coexistence of these two ingredients.
