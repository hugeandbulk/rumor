## Barabasi Albert

What are the properties of Barabasi Albert model?

The Barabási–Albert model is one of several proposed models that generate scale-free networks. It incorporates two important general concepts: growth and preferential attachment. Both growth and preferential attachment exist widely in real networks.

What is Barabasi law?

In summary, the Barabási-Albert model indicates that two simple mechanisms, growth and preferential attachment, are responsible for the emergence of scale-free networks. The origin of the power law and the as- sociated hubs is a rich-gets-richer phenomenon induced by the coexistence of these two ingredients.

What is the diameter of a network?

Diameter of a network

It is the shortest distance between the two most distant nodes in the network. In other words, once the shortest path length from every node to all other nodes is calculated, the diameter is the longest of all the calculated path lengths.
