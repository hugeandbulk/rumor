verb

verb: rumor

_to be reported as a rumour and possible but may not be true_. 

_Rumours are stories or pieces of stories that might be true or false and that have the characteristic of quickly spreading from a person to another. They are not systematically negative but they can become very harmful when they are based on stereotypes, i.e. on unchecked and prefixed ideas about what someone or something is like_.

Actions:
- `rumor ();`
- `confute ();`
- `erroneous ();`


What is the meaning of Confutate?

_A confutation is the act of refuting someone's point forcefully. Accused criminals must offer confutation if they hope to be found innocent. If you know the verb confute — which means to overwhelm through an argument — this noun will be a no-brainer: it refers to the act of confuting, or a statement that confutes_.

What is the difference between refute and confute?

_To refute a statement is to demonstrate its falsity by argument or countervailing proof; confute is substantially the same in meaning, tho differing in usage. To our mind this astonishment does not confute the idea that this act of obedience was prompted by faith_.
